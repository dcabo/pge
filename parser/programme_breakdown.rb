# Parser for programme expense breakdowns (Serie Roja / Red books)
#
# Note: the breakdowns in the Green books (Serie Verde) have more detail on the line
#       items, but they do not include the Social Security expenses. So we need to
#       combine both. (Or use only the Red ones, but since I started with the green
#       ones... oh, well.)
#
# NOTE: WORKS ONLY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAMMES RIGHT NOW (FIXME?!?)

  #       programme breakdown what type of entity is doing the expense, i.e. whether

  #       The entity breakdown parser extracts this information, but it's not actually used
  #       at the moment, so it's not an issue. If needed, there should exist an Entity table
  #       with this type of info, instead of having one single data table (TODO).
